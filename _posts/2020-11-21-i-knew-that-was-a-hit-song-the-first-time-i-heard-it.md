title: I knew that was a hit song the first time I heard it
---
I can't tell you how many times I heard that in my years in the business.  One of the truths of music is that everyone is an expert at what they do....and music.  The best advice I ever received  was at a party from friends who were also struggling and looking for that big break, it came from the wife of a singer I was working with.  She said, "Why don't you just find a group like the Beatles?"  I just hit my forehead with my hand and said, "God, thank you, I never thought about that...how could I be so stupid?"  Turns out, there never was another group like the Beatles.  That hit song thing has some merit, however.  Forget the fact that by the time someone heard a song on the radio, it was a hit already!  But there is something about a hit that immediately grabs you and from the first time you hear it to the time it's an "oldie" it never stops being a hit.  My own personal theory is that once the songwriter writes that song it's not his song anymore...it's yours...it's mine...it's universal.  It affects us emotionally and like a good story, we become immersed in that emotion. I can't imagine a world without that.  What those people should have said is, "I knew that was a hit song the first time I heard it...and now it's mine."
