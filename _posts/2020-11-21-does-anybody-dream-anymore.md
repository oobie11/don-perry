title: Does Anybody Dream Anymore?
---
When I was a kid, I would sometimes just lay on the grass, look up at the sky and dream.

Orison Swett Marden said, "All men who have achieved great things have been great dreamers".  My dreams turned into passion and that passion became the motivation to go after what I wanted in my life.  

As I watch my 15th graduation at Carmel High School, I wonder if these kids who live in a technological world that I could never have imagined, have been given time to dream.  They've been given everything else.  Sadly they believe that hard work will get you into the best college, which is the only way to be successful in today's world.  That prestigious learning institution opens the doors to the top jobs and earning power (which they will need to pay off their enormous student loan). I'm sorry, that's not my idea of success.

My dream of success was always the same.  I wanted to get up every morning and do what I wanted to do, what I was passionate about, and what I would do for nothing if I could.
I'm just hoping that there are a few in this class who have been asked what they are passionate about, what they would like to do, and what makes them happy.  I hope as they listen to all the interminable speeches, that I see a few drift off into dreamland.  Those are the ones I'll put my money on.
